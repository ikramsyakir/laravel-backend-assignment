```sql
SELECT u.id AS user_id, c.balance, c.created_at
FROM users u
         LEFT JOIN credits c
                   ON c.user_id = u.id
                       AND c.created_at = (SELECT MAX(c2.created_at)
                                           FROM credits c2
                                           WHERE c2.user_id = u.id
                                             AND c2.created_at <= '2022-12-31 23:59:59');
```

4. What is the difference between after_save VS after_commit? (Rails) OR What is the difference between saved VS
   afterCommit? (Laravel)

| saved                                                                                                | afterCommit                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fires immediately after a model is saved (created or updated)                                        | Fires after the database transaction is committed                               |
| Fires within the database transaction if one is active                                               | Only executes if the transaction successfully completes                         |
| If the transaction is rolled back later, any side effects from saved listeners have already occurred | If the transaction rolls back, afterCommit listeners never fire                 |
| This is the default behavior for most model events                                                   | Safer for external side effects like sending emails, API calls, or queuing jobs |

5. Usersâ€™ have many comments and comments can be liked by other users. Write an SQL statement to count how many
   users liked that comment.

```sql
SELECT comments.id                  AS comment_id,
       comments.user_id             AS comment_owner_id,
       COUNT(comment_likes.user_id) AS total_likes
FROM comments
         LEFT JOIN comment_likes
                   ON comment_likes.comment_id = comments.id
GROUP BY comments.id, comments.user_id;
```

6. A snail can climb up 3 meters a day and it will drop 2 meters at night. The well is 11 meters deep. How many days
   will the snail need to come out from the well and the snail starts climbing in the morning?

---

Daily Progress Table

| Day | Position at Start | Climbs (+3m) | Position After Climb | Falls (-2m) | Position at End | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | 0m | +3m | 3m | -2m | 1m | Net gain: 1m |
| 2 | 1m | +3m | 4m | -2m | 2m | Net gain: 1m |
| 3 | 2m | +3m | 5m | -2m | 3m | Net gain: 1m |
| 4 | 3m | +3m | 6m | -2m | 4m | Net gain: 1m |
| 5 | 4m | +3m | 7m | -2m | 5m | Net gain: 1m |
| 6 | 5m | +3m | 8m | -2m | 6m | Net gain: 1m |
| 7 | 6m | +3m | 9m | -2m | 7m | Net gain: 1m |
| 8 | 7m | +3m | 10m | -2m | 8m | Net gain: 1m |
| 9 | 8m | +3m | 11m | â€” | **OUT!** | No fall |

---

Formula


$$
\text{Days} = \frac{(\text{Well Depth} - \text{Climb per Day})}{\text{Net Progress per Day}} + 1
$$

Example:

$$
\text{Days} = \frac{(11 - 3)}{1} + 1 = 9
$$

**Answer: 9 days**

---
**Final Answer:**  
The snail will take **9 days** to climb out of the 11-meter well.
